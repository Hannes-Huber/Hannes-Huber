@Hannes-Huber

My name is Hannes and here are a few things about myself:
- I like black tea, rollercoasters, good books, gaming and 3D Graphics
- AR, MR, VR and XR (so basically every field with an R at the end) is awesome!!
- I'm currently studying at the University of Media in Stuttgart, Germany
- If you're working on a project and need a 3D / Engine / XR dude, hit me up!!

PS: Why is ASCII art not working in preview mode? xD
